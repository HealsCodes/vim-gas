# VIM-GAS

This vim bundle adds advanced syntax highlighting for GNU as (AT&T).

This file defines a (almost) complete syntax for GNU as assembler. 

My motivation in writing this was the lack of a complete, working syntax for this 
common assembler. 

For now the basic as directives as well as the Intel / AMD, ARM (thumb) and AVR instruction sets are included.  
Opcodes supporting a size suffix are recognized plain as well as suffixed with b/w/l/q. 

## What does it look like?

## Supported instructions a per version 0.16: 

- X86 common instruction set (8086 - 686) 
- Katmai Streaming SIMD instructions (SSE -- a.k.a. KNI, XMM, MMX2) 
- Introduced in Deschutes but necessary for SSE support 
- XSAVE group (AVX and extended state) 
- Generic memory operations 
- New MMX instructions introduced in Katmai 
- AMD Enhanced 3DNow! (Athlon) instructions 
- Willamette SSE2 Cacheability Instructions 
- Willamette MMX instructions (SSE2 SIMD Integer Instructions) 
- Willamette Streaming SIMD instructions (SSE2) 
- Prescott New Instructions (SSE3) 
- VMX Instructions 
- Extended Page Tables VMX instructions 
- Tejas New Instructions (SSSE3) 
- AMD SSE4A 
- New instructions in Barcelona 
- Penryn New Instructions (SSE4.1) 
- Nehalem New Instructions (SSE4.2) 
- AMD SSE5 instructions 
- Intel SMX 
- Geode (Cyrix) 3DNow! additions 
- Intel AES instructions 
- Intel AVX AES instructions 
- Intel AVX instructions 
- Intel AVX2 instructions
- Intel Carry-Less Multiplication instructions (CLMUL) 
- Intel AVX Carry-Less Multiplication instructions (CLMUL) 
- Intel Fused Multiply-Add instructions (FMA) 
- VIA (Centaur) security instructions 
- AMD XOP, FMA4 and CVT16 instructions (SSE5) 
- Systematic names for the hinting nop instructions 
- ARM (Thumb)
- AVR

You can set different highlighting for each set listed above by adding a line like this to you .vimrc: 

```vim
  hi def link gasOpcodeX86_PENT_SSE  <some_highlighting> 
```

## per-file opcode enable / disable 

Since version 0.6 it is possible to disable sets of opcodes by either CPU they where introduced in or by their extension name. 
This is done by setting a special variable recognized by gas.vim to the list of disabled opcodes. 

E.g. 

```vim
" globally disable all x86_64 opcodes 
:let g:gasDisableOpcodes='x86_64' 


" disable SSE and SSE2 for this buffer 
let b:gasDisableOpcodes='sse sse2' 
```

Disabled opcodes will be highlighted as errors. 

recognized CPU groups:

           186, 286, 386, 3862, 486, 8086, amd, future, ia64, katmai, nehalem, 
            p6, pentium_m, pentium, prescott, sandybridge, x64, x642, x86_64 

recognized extension groups: 

           base, 3dnow, mmx, mmx2, sse, sse2, sse3, ssse3, sse4.1, sse4.2, sse4a, 
           sse5, avx, fma, vmx 


I hope this syntax file will be useful to other people 
  \- but don't blame me if it doesn't suit your needs. 

## CPP preprocessor macros

GAS allows code to be processed by the same preprocessor used for C/C++ code. 
So directives like `#include`, `#define` etc. will be highlighted using the C 
syntax highlighter if available. 

This behavior can be turned off by setting the `gasDisablePreproc` option 
either globally in your .vimrc or on a per-buffer basis:

```vim
" globally disable preprocessor macro detection
:let g:gasDisablePreproc=1 


" disable only for this buffer 
let gasDisablePreproc=1 
```

## Installation

This syntax file can either be installed manually, by using pathogen or vundle.

### Manual Installation

Download gas.vim and copy the file to .vim/syntax/ in your home folder. 
Add this line to the end of your file: 

```vim
/* vim: ft=gas : 
*/ 
```

## Installation with Git & Pathogen

- Install [pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) into `~/.vim/autoload/` and add the
   following line to your `~/.vimrc`:

        call pathogen#infect()

- Make a clone of the `vim-gas` repository:

        $ mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
        $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
        $ git clone https://github.com/HealsCodes/vim-gas

- OR use git submodules:

        $ git submodule add https://github.com/HealsCodes/vim-gas.git bundle/vim-gas
        $ git submodule init

## Installation with Vundle

- Install and setup [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) then add this to your `~/.vimrc` inside
   the `vundle#begin()` / `vundle#end()` block:

        Plugin shirk/vim-gas

- Restart your vim and call `VundleInstall`
